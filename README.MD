# STEPS TAKEN

1. Created a new folder
2. Created a new node.js application using npm init-y
3. Installed the required dependencies: npm install â€“save express, body-parser, web-push

## SERVER SIDE

4. Imported dependencies for building the server side in the index.js file
5. Generated and set the VAPID keys using: ./node_modules/.bin/web-push generate-vapid-keys. These keys will allow us to send push messages without having to set up a messaging service. They also identify who is sending the push notification
6. Created a subscribe route where the client sends the post requests. It will send the notification to the service worker

## CLIENT SIDE

7. Set the static path
8. Create the required files
9. Set up the service worker which is a script run by the browser in the background separate from the web page and bridges the browser and the network. It usually intercepts requests made by the document in the browser and redirects requests to cache memory to allow offline access
